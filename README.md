# TicketHive

This is the school group project TicketHive where we learned .Net blazor project form.
It resulted in this Event Tickets application. The group consisted of me, Sebastian, 
Abdullahi, Rebeca and Markus.

To start the application clone the repo, and seed local sql database in package manager console with commands: 
```
update-database -Context ApplicationDbContext
update-database -Context EventDbContext
```

Then simply fire up the application and follow instructions to create a user login.
